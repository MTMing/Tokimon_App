####Introduction of the project
######This project is about Tokimon!!! A Tokimon is a special creature living in Korea. Tokimons have different shapes and ######sizes. Also, they have special abilities including fly, fight, fire, spray water, electrify and freeze others. We use ######integer from 0 to 100 to measure their ability. Tokimon trainsers are a special group of people who can control and ######train their Tokimons. Their main job is to catch Tokimons and train them properly in order to increase their ######abilities. In this project, we are going to write an application to keep track of the Tokimons and their trainers.
